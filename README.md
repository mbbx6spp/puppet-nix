# puppet-nix module

## WTF is this?

Are you using Puppet now but would rather get to using Nix and eventually
NixOS? Then use this Puppet module to get Nix installed on all your
infrastructure. Then who can argue?

**Ask forgiveness not permission. Subvert the system. And do it now.**

If any of the Ruby fanboys currently managing your infrastructure asks what
nix does, then just tell them its a web app that serves awesome dog gifs.
They'll lose all interest!

Quick distract them with real cat gifs.

It's cool. We are almost at the finish line.

Yes!?

Well done, you have just saved your sanity at work.

## Other notes

Just subvert the system already. Start now, before convergent configuration
management systems corrupt your soul because they depend on package managers
that modify global state unsafely (wait, isn't it always unsafe to do so?).
